# ⚠️ Warning: Execute with Caution ⚠️

**Do not execute unverified commands in your terminal. Executing unknown or untrusted commands can potentially damage your computer, destroy files, and result in data loss. Always ensure that the commands you run are safe and verified.**

## Disclaimer

We are not responsible for any mishaps or damages that may occur from using this software. It is highly recommended that you fully understand how this software works before using it.

### How It Works

InitialTerm is a terminal application that leverages the Ollama API to convert user queries into command-line commands. When you input a query, the software sends it to the Ollama API, which processes the query using a specified model and returns a terminal command. This command is then displayed to you for execution. You have the option to confirm or cancel the execution of the generated command.

**Please ensure that you review and understand the commands before executing them to prevent any unintended consequences.**
